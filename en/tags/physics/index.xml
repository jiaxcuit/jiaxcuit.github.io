      <description>A place to note down where I got extra info on new topics or things that I needed to catch up with.
Also some notes on important ideas.
Poisson distribution The Connection Between the Poisson and Binomial Distributions
Derivation of Poisson distribution from binomial distribution, when the number of trials $n$ is large and the probability of success $p$ is small.

      <description>Introduction This article includes:
 Short-term revision method My personal experience Online resource  Scenarios suitable for applying this article&amp;rsquo;s method:
 Exam preparation, namely, to improve grades, but not to better your grasp of knowledge Tight schedule (within about a month before the exam?) Plenty of free time  My Experience 0. &amp;ldquo;Cramming&amp;rdquo; and I: Some Unimportant Words? I&amp;rsquo;m a procrastinator, so for many exams, even though I had time to prepare, I still ended up doing short-term preparation, aka cramming.</description>

      <description>Transformers are closely related to induction in the study of electricity and magnetism. Here, I share an article1: Weekly Three Questions - Grade 12: (170) What is &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; for an ideal transformer? (【每周三题】高三【170】理想变压器都“理想”了什么？), by Wu Aixiong (吴爱兄). This article has largely deepened my understanding of transformers.
