      <description>Introduction This is the first post in my blog series called &amp;ldquo;My Tips &amp;amp; Experience with IB Textbooks&amp;rdquo;. The IB subjects covered in this series are DP Physics, Math AA, Chemistry, History, and Chinese A Lit. The corresponding levels and syllabus versions (year of first assessment) are as follows:

      <description>Transformers are closely related to induction in the study of electricity and magnetism. Here, I share an article1: Weekly Three Questions - Grade 12: (170) What is &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; for an ideal transformer? (【每周三题】高三【170】理想变压器都“理想”了什么？), by Wu Aixiong (吴爱兄). This article has largely deepened my understanding of transformers.
