      <description>A bit of background before we get into this blog post:
This is a complaint I’ve written on our university’s questionnaire for student accommodation experience. The things I’ve talked about are painfully true.
Living in the university student accommodation has barely been enjoyable for me… Posting this on my blog is my form of a protest, I guess, but it’s mainly for me to record facts and feelings before memories fade away, and to let people see what sort of things can happen.</description>

      <title>Choosing a Seat in the Library</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to the university library for half a year or so, and I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a bit about a tiny thing—choosing a seat.
First of all, nothing is more natural than to make sure that seat is usable, like you need to check that the plugboard, chair, and PC (if any) all work, and so on and so forth. Dont think it&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous, I&amp;rsquo;ve come across plugs that constantly switch the power on and off, chairs with missing wheels that will tilt almost sideways once it&amp;rsquo;s sat on, or those with no soft sponge but only hard metal wires/pipes, and PCs plugged into power but won&amp;rsquo;t turn on&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s a week without any update. The reason is that, I found out with fear and worries that blogging seemed to become a burden instead of an enjoyable hobby for me. When I focused on finishing the series on textbooks, I slowly fell into a trap that I dug for myself—I narrowed my mind to simply doing work and couldn&amp;rsquo;t escape from the whirlpool of endless tasks.
So, I gave myself a break.</description>

      <title>Short Note: Excellence or Involution?</title>
      <link>//jiaxcuit.github.io/en/posts/excellence-or-involution/</link>

      <description>When neijuan1, or involution, becomes a buzzword and everyone&amp;rsquo;s source of anxiety, when we oppose neijuan and turn to tangping2, are we starting to be complacent with our status quo and even starting to deny excellence?
Today, I bumped into a post of an old classmate on WeChat Moments on this topic. I could really feel her enthusiasm for her subject of studying and her honesty with herself. That honesty is a kind of courage—the courage to recognize her own shortcomings and others&#39; excellence, the courage to stay passionate about her subject and to stay motivated despite challenges and difficulties in her studies.</description>

      <title>Short Note: Mother Tongue</title>

      <description>Last weekend, I was on a team with some students from my school for an online math competition. One of the students on the team (let&amp;rsquo;s call her Student-A) who was from another grade had a Chinese name, so I assumed that she was Chinese or ethnically Chinese. When we met at school, I was &amp;ldquo;relieved&amp;rdquo; to come up and suggest, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk in Chinese!&amp;rdquo; But of course it didn&amp;rsquo;t go well in the reality.</description>

      <title>Short Note: University Application</title>

      <description>I just helped one of my classmates practice her presentation and watched her present her work. It&amp;rsquo;s an entrance test for a Dutch university and the real thing is coming tomorrow. And it&amp;rsquo;s not simply her presenting to the teachers—she&amp;rsquo;ll present to other applicants, listen to them, talk to them, and the teachers are going to ask her questions. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take her a whole morning.
That Dutch university has so many strict entrance requirements.</description>
