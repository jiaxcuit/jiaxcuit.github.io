      <title>A Flashback to Primary School Programming: Scratch</title>

      <description>Because of some reasons, recently, I started using Scratch again. And it&amp;rsquo;s just because of a sudden idea, I made a game of dodging obstacles.
So I thought, I already made the game anyway. Why don&amp;rsquo;t I share it with you all? For those of you who share my memories, maybe this game can refresh the memory of your wonderful childhood and programming in primary school; for those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t share this memory, maybe it can be a nice, relaxing game for you.</description>

      <title>Tips for Organizing Electronic Files</title>

      <guid>//jiaxcuit.github.io/en/posts/organizing-e-files/</guid>
      <description>After having to work with many electronic files during my years in the IB, I developed my own file organization method.
Naming Make It Meaningful Give your files meaningful names. It&amp;rsquo;s very likely that you need to revise your essay draft multiple times, so you can&amp;rsquo;t really tell which draft is the final one until you get close to submission. So don&amp;rsquo;t just call it final, and then the revised version real final, and real final final, etc.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s a week without any update. The reason is that, I found out with fear and worries that blogging seemed to become a burden instead of an enjoyable hobby for me. When I focused on finishing the series on textbooks, I slowly fell into a trap that I dug for myself—I narrowed my mind to simply doing work and couldn&amp;rsquo;t escape from the whirlpool of endless tasks.
So, I gave myself a break.</description>

 Short-term revision method My personal experience Online resource  Scenarios suitable for applying this article&amp;rsquo;s method:
 Exam preparation, namely, to improve grades, but not to better your grasp of knowledge Tight schedule (within about a month before the exam?) Plenty of free time  My Experience 0. &amp;ldquo;Cramming&amp;rdquo; and I: Some Unimportant Words? I&amp;rsquo;m a procrastinator, so for many exams, even though I had time to prepare, I still ended up doing short-term preparation, aka cramming.</description>

      <description>Introduction This article is on my own note-taking method, which I gradually developed mainly in my 2 years in IB DP, by exploring and experimenting with a range of methods and borrowing from others. During that time, I refused to compromise on the shortcomings in my note-taking method as I continuously tried new methods to arrive at my current set of note-taking methods which satisfies me for now. Together with my current note-taking method, there&amp;rsquo;re some principles of note-taking–my ultimate goal of note-taking.</description>

      <guid>//jiaxcuit.github.io/en/posts/excellence-or-involution/</guid>
      <description>When neijuan1, or involution, becomes a buzzword and everyone&amp;rsquo;s source of anxiety, when we oppose neijuan and turn to tangping2, are we starting to be complacent with our status quo and even starting to deny excellence?
Today, I bumped into a post of an old classmate on WeChat Moments on this topic. I could really feel her enthusiasm for her subject of studying and her honesty with herself. That honesty is a kind of courage—the courage to recognize her own shortcomings and others&#39; excellence, the courage to stay passionate about her subject and to stay motivated despite challenges and difficulties in her studies.</description>

      <description>Last weekend, I was on a team with some students from my school for an online math competition. One of the students on the team (let&amp;rsquo;s call her Student-A) who was from another grade had a Chinese name, so I assumed that she was Chinese or ethnically Chinese. When we met at school, I was &amp;ldquo;relieved&amp;rdquo; to come up and suggest, &amp;ldquo;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk in Chinese!&amp;rdquo; But of course it didn&amp;rsquo;t go well in the reality.</description>

      <description>Video to Share As the IB exams are approaching, I started to look for a study method more suitable for short term preparation. Just at the same time, Coach_K updated a video on Bilibili about this exact topic. I watched it and thought he indeed had a point, and the video was a great reminder for me, so I&amp;rsquo;m sharing it here1: CK - How Should You Prepare for Exams?

      <guid>//jiaxcuit.github.io/en/posts/ideal-transformer-assumptions/</guid>
      <description>Transformers are closely related to induction in the study of electricity and magnetism. Here, I share an article1: Weekly Three Questions - Grade 12: (170) What is &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; for an ideal transformer? (【每周三题】高三【170】理想变压器都“理想”了什么？), by Wu Aixiong (吴爱兄). This article has largely deepened my understanding of transformers.
This article is from Physics Learning Research (物理学习研究), a WeChat Official Account. It posts many other similar articles on physics that investigate into individual topics, including example problems, explanations, and exercises to consolidate knowledge.</description>

      <description>I just helped one of my classmates practice her presentation and watched her present her work. It&amp;rsquo;s an entrance test for a Dutch university and the real thing is coming tomorrow. And it&amp;rsquo;s not simply her presenting to the teachers—she&amp;rsquo;ll present to other applicants, listen to them, talk to them, and the teachers are going to ask her questions. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take her a whole morning.
That Dutch university has so many strict entrance requirements.</description>
