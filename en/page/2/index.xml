        <title>Assumptions for an Ideal Transformer</title>

        <description>Jiaxcuit //jiaxcuit.github.io/en/posts/ideal-transformer-assumptions/ -&lt;p&gt;Transformers are closely related to induction in the study of electricity and magnetism. Here, I share an article&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/T0DcwTlz0DYTKsijbmVpBA&#34;&gt;Weekly Three Questions - Grade 12: (170) What is &amp;ldquo;ideal&amp;rdquo; for an ideal transformer?&lt;/a&gt; (【每周三题】高三【170】理想变压器都“理想”了什么？), by Wu Aixiong (吴爱兄). This article has largely deepened my understanding of transformers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article is from &lt;strong&gt;Physics Learning Research&lt;/strong&gt; (物理学习研究), a WeChat Official Account. It posts many other similar articles on physics that investigate into individual topics, including example problems, explanations, and exercises to consolidate knowledge. Most of the content is high quality and is suitable for students from grade 9 to grade 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article explains the &lt;strong&gt;components&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;theoretical principles&lt;/strong&gt; of a transformer, and then explains the &lt;strong&gt;assumptions&lt;/strong&gt; of an ideal transformer. The article also discusses in detail the various &lt;strong&gt;conclusions&lt;/strong&gt; regarding transformers, such as the conditions for $\frac{\epsilon_1}{\epsilon_2} = \frac{V_1}{V_2}$ to be true. The article covers topics such as &lt;strong&gt;inductive reactance&lt;/strong&gt; which is not covered in IB physics, but it is mentioned less frequently in the article and only appears at the very end. The four exercises in the article are helpful as they closely relate to the content in IB Physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that due to formatting issues, the first part of question (1) is centered below the first picture, however it is not a caption of the picture, so be careful not to think it is the caption or miss it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading! I&amp;rsquo;m not a teacher but just an IB student who has bits of thoughts. If you have more thoughts and insights, you are welcome to share them here! (Also look for contact information at the end of the &amp;ldquo;About&amp;rdquo; section of this blog.) I&amp;rsquo;m really curious about what other people think!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re doing Chinese A Lit, then I assume you understand Chinese quite well. (And I hope you do 😂) So here&amp;rsquo;s the link to the same post in Chinese (Simplified): &lt;a href=&#34;https://jiaxcuit.github.io/zh/posts/p1-skills-online-resources/&#34;&gt;中文文学 P1 写作方法和范文&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts or comments are welcomed!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Short Note: University Application</title>
        <link>//jiaxcuit.github.io/en/posts/uni-app/</link>

        <description>Jiaxcuit //jiaxcuit.github.io/en/posts/uni-app/ -&lt;p&gt;I just helped one of my classmates practice her presentation and watched her present her work. It&amp;rsquo;s an entrance test for a Dutch university and the real thing is coming tomorrow. And it&amp;rsquo;s not simply her presenting to the teachers—she&amp;rsquo;ll present to other applicants, listen to them, talk to them, and the teachers are going to ask her questions. It&amp;rsquo;s going to take her a whole morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That Dutch university has so many strict entrance requirements. The test covers almost everything that should be taught in their undergraduate course, and the most annoying thing is that they don&amp;rsquo;t give a clear set of criteria. When it comes to grading criteria, I have to admit, the IB is really good. No matter the criteria are good or bad, the IB always gives clear rules about how each assessment should be graded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We just finished our mock exams two weeks ago and I&amp;rsquo;m still pretty lost and exhausted, but my lovely classmate had already received her assignment from the university in the middle of the exam week, and had been slowly doing that assignment until now when she is finally close to finishing it. That&amp;rsquo;s such a pain. I can&amp;rsquo;t help but think back to my own application season. It was the same—staying up late and having mental breakdowns. Totally relatable.&lt;/p&gt;
